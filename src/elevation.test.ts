/**
 * The elevation contract an instanced kind has to satisfy by hand.
 *
 * A feature's stored Y is always 0 — the surface it stands on is resolved at render
 * time. For a per-node kind the host does that for free, but a collective renderer
 * draws into one `InstancedMesh`, and the host's `FloorElevationSystem` only writes
 * to a node's *registered* object, which here is the invisible selection proxy. So
 * `instanced.tsx` resolves it, through the functions under test.
 *
 * Every assertion below would read 0 under the old `node.position[1]`, which is
 * exactly why the bug survived: in a flat test scene the broken and correct code
 * agree.
