/**
 * Where a feature actually stands: its stored base plus whatever the host elects
 * under it — a stacked slab (deck, plinth) or the sculpted ground.
 *
 * Stored positions are flat by contract (`[x, 0, z]`); the lift is presentation
 * and is never committed. For an ordinary per-node kind the host's
 * `FloorElevationSystem` applies it for free, but it writes to each node's
 * *registered* object — and for a collective renderer that object is the
 * invisible selection proxy, not the instance. So an instanced kind has to
 * resolve this itself, at every point it writes a transform. Reading
 * `node.position[1]` raw is what left every feature at `y = 0`: floating under a
 * deck and buried in a hillside.
 *
 * Kept in its own module, free of any Three.js or React import, so the seam is
 * testable without a canvas — see `elevation.test.ts`.
